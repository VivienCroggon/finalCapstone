Final Capstone Project - Task Manager

The goal of this project was to utilise the knowledge I have learned throughout the CoGrammar Software Engineering fundamentals course. This includes list, dictionaries and functions to refactor the code of an existing task manager Python file.

The primary goals were to ensure the code is efficient, modular, and readable. 

The program simulates a task organiser for a business. It takes login details from the user and stores them in a test file. The user can add more users, tasks, edit existing tasks to mark them complete, and generate statistics on all current tasks. There is additional functionality for admin users.

Original code written by the excellent tutors at CoGrammar.
